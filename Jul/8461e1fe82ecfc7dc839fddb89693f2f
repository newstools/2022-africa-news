                            Consultations between the Department of Water and Sanitation and key stakeholders across the country are underway to determine bulk water tariffs for the financial year 2022/23.


                                We are guided by the National Water Act 36 of 1998 which states that the Minster of Water and Sanitation is required to establish a pricing for raw water charges
                            

Director for Institutional Establishment in the Department of Water and Sanitation in the Northern Cape Mr. Tenda Rasikhanya, says two stakeholder engagement meetings are scheduled for the Northern Cape. “We are meeting with stakeholders in Upington at the Desert Palace on 20 July 2022 and the Kimberley engagement is scheduled at the Kimberley Garden Court for the 21 July 2022 respectively."

“We are guided by the National Water Act 36 of 1998 which states that the Minster of Water and Sanitation is required to establish a pricing for raw water charges.”

Rasikhanya further indicated that “supplying water to all people at an acceptable level of assurance and quality, costs money, both in terms of capital investment in infrastructure, and the operation and maintenance associated with water treatment, bulk water distribution and reticulation in human settlements”.

The pricing of water is based on the following Pricing Principles: User pay, Polluter pay, Ecological sustainability, Differentiated charges, Accountability and Governance.
