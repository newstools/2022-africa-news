                            The President of the Republic, Mr Wavel Ramkalawan has applauded the recent seizure of over two tons of drugs by the French vessel Le Floréal as part of an EU NAVFOR ATALANTA Counter-Narcotics operation. 



“Since the beginning of this operation, Seychelles pledged its full support to ensure maritime security in the fight against terrorism, drug trafficking and other crimes. We are proud to be associated with the successful operations of the French surveillance frigate Le Floréal. One of the boats captured was only 200 nautical miles from Victoria, indicating that these drugs were destined for Seychelles. Seychelles will continue to cooperate with its international partners in the fight against drugs” said President Ramkalawan.
