                            The Central American Parliament (Parlacen) expressed its "sincere congratulations" to Morocco following the efforts made by Rabat and Madrid to "end the dispute over the Moroccan Sahara."


                                We express our satisfaction with the guarantee of sovereignty and territorial integrity
                            

Parlacen President Guillermo Daniel Ortega Reyes sent a letter to Morocco's Ambassador to Guatemala Tarik Louajri, in which he expressed his "sincere congratulations to the government of Morocco" following the steps taken by the two kingdoms to reach agreements "that put an end to the dispute over the Moroccan Sahara."

Parlacen President also backed the respect of Morocco's sovereignty and territorial integrity. "We express our satisfaction with the guarantee of sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as prosperity in relations between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Government of Spain; two countries linked by history."

The Guatemala-based Parlacen is the regional and permanent body of political and democratic representation of the Central American Integration System (SICA). It is composed of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and the Dominican Republic.

Morocco, a Parlacen observer member since 2015, obtained the status of "advanced partner" last February, in recognition of its role in strengthening South-South cooperation.
