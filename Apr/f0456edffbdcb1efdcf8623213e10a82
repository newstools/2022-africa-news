LAGOS, Nigeria, April 25, 2022/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            Leading African digital payments company DPO Group (www.DPOGroup.com) has added a new form of payment that will allow merchants to get paid by their customers via a USSD code. This new feature allows merchants to receive payments from customers who don’t have access to mobile banking or a payment card.



Paired with DPO’s robust and scalable payment offering, USSD payments enable merchants to grow their customer base by accommodating as many payment methods as possible, getting paid from different shoppers across Africa. DPO has developed integrated payments technology to support businesses of all sizes in over 20 countries and accepts payments securely and swiftly in all currencies and through many payment methods including virtual cards, mobile money, and e-wallets.

DPO’s country manager in Nigeria, Chidinma Aroyewun, said: “As the shift to a cashless, digital economy becomes a reality, we want to make it easier for both the customer and merchant to carry out transactions. We are passionate about empowering our merchants with the tools they need to grow.”
