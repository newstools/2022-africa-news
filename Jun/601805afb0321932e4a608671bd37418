                            Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Molly Phee will travel to Sudan from June 5-9.

While in Sudan, Assistant Secretary Phee will meet with a wide range of Sudanese stakeholders and political actors and urge them to seize the opportunity offered by the UN-AU-IGAD-facilitated process to restore the transition to democracy and economic stability, and to advance peace.  



The United States is committed to supporting the democratic aspirations of the Sudanese people.
