TrackTik was founded in 2013 with the mission of providing a complete set of tools through easy-to-use software and taking the fear out of technology in order to put it to work for security workforce management.  From their origins in Montreal, Canada, TrackTik provides solutions to over 35 countries across 6 continents and has been steadily innovating the way companies leverage workforce technology for security operations.  The platform provides a full suite of applications, combining the needs of back-office administration to front line security operations.



As a result of this new venture, physical security companies now can leverage the combined best-practices of two leading security workforce management providers, providing multiple options for how they can manage security operations.  Additionally, the combined technology teams of Trackforce Valiant and TrackTik Software will enable the company to further innovate and enhance their solutions further than any other software provider in the industry.



“The physical security market continues to grow, and with that so does the need for solutions that can grow with them,” said Simon Ferragne, CEO of TrackTik.  “This acquisition positions us as the dominant leader for security workforce technology, and we are thrilled to work together to continue our mission to build innovative, leading-edge solutions for our customers.”



Both companies will continue to maintain operations in service of their customers and partners, with Trevor Campion overseeing the combined organization as CEO, and Simon Ferragne, TrackTik’s CEO, entering the role of CTO.  Simon Ferragne and TrackTik’s investors, CDPQ Investissements, Georgian, Klass Capital, Inovia Capital, Intercap, and Schauer Ventures have reinvested a portion of their proceeds in the newly combined entity to help foster continued growth in the company. TrackTik will continue to operate and maintain its presence in Quebec as one of Canada’s top small and medium employers.  Trackforce Valiant and TrackTik will collaborate on developing and innovating security solutions that include Time and Labor Management, Guard Touring, Incident Management, Dispatch and Mobile Patrol, as well as Billing and Payroll management.
