JOHANNESBURG, South Africa, June 14, 2022/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            Dr Valentina Kretzschmar, Energy Transition Director at Capricorn Energy, a UK-based independent oil and gas exploration and production firm with operations in Africa, will be coming to Cape Town to shape discussions around environmental, social and governance (ESG) within the continent’s oil and gas sector at African Energy Week (AEW) (https://AECWeek.com), Africa’s premier event for the oil and gas sector, which takes place from 18 – 21 October 2022.



With over 25 years of experience in the energy industry and an expert regarding the energy transition in the context of the oil and gas sector, the presence and participation of Dr Kretzschmar at AEW 2022 will be crucial in helping African energy stakeholders and policymakers align business models and policies with global energy market and climate change trends.
                                Climate change, energy transition and lack of gender diversity are some of the key trends restricting African oil and gas markets from realizing their potential
                            

Prior to driving Capricorn Energy’s sustainability strategy, which includes reaching net-zero operations by 2040 while maximizing oil and gas production, Dr Kretzschmar spent 18 years analyzing the financial performances of Russian, European, Central Asian and Caucasus’ oil and gas firms and their ESG evolution with research firm Wood Mackenzie. An engineer by profession, Dr Kretzschmar worked for Edinburgh Petroleum Services, as a Research Fellow with the University of Edinburgh and for engineering, environmental and strategic consultancy, Ricardo.

With Africa looking at accelerating the deployment of low-carbon energy technologies across the oil and gas sector to remain a climate champion while maximizing the exploitation of its vastly untapped hydrocarbon resources, insights from Dr Kretzschmar at AEW 2022 will be key for African energy producers. With investments in African energy declining due to global climate policy-related issues, Dr Kretzschmar will be instrumental in shedding light on how Africa can align its oil and gas operations with global climate sustainability standards to attract investments from international financial institutions. At AEW 2022, Dr Kretzschmar will also participate in campaigns and discussions aimed at boosting women participation across the entire energy value chain.

“Climate change, energy transition and lack of gender diversity are some of the key trends restricting African oil and gas markets from realizing their potential. The Chamber is proud to have leaders like Dr Valentina Kretzschmar at AEW 2022 as we formulate solutions to address the industry’s critical issues,” states NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber (AEC), adding that, “As Tullow Oil and Capricorn Energy merge into a single African energy giant, we hope to see the prioritization of ESG intensifying as oil and gas exploitation also maximizes.”

Under the theme, ‘Exploring and Investing in Africa’s Energy Future while Driving an Enabling Environment,’ AEW 2022 will host Dr Valentina Kretzschmar in panel discussions and high-level meetings to discuss challenges and opportunities across the African energy sector, post-merger opportunities for Capricorn Energy, the role women will continue to play in driving innovation and growth across the sector and how African E&P players can implement effective ESG policies to drive sustainable operations.
