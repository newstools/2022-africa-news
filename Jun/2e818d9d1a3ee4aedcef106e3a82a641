‘African countries are playing an increasingly important role in international politics. We cooperate closely with many African countries and the African Union. Their assessments and experience are vital to us, and we have benefited greatly from their input in connection with our work in the UN Security Council,’ said Ms Huitfeldt.

A number of African countries have experienced steady economic growth and are making progress in relation to human rights and democracy. But drought, hunger and growing humanitarian needs as a result of climate change, conflict and violent extremism pose challenges to stability and are hampering development in many African countries.

‘Only the private sector can create all the jobs that are needed to ensure economic growth and development in Africa. Several of the African ministers called for increased trade and investment from the Nordic countries. There are significant opportunities for the Norwegian business sector in Africa, and I am pleased that many Norwegian companies are operating in African countries,’ said Ms Huitfeldt.
