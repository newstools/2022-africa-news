Since the launch of the Licensing Round, we have received a number of requests to extend the deadline for submitting proposals, which is scheduled for 6th June 2022. The Government welcomes these requests and acknowledges the need for many companies to have more time to finalise and submit their proposals.

Therefore, as a result of this, the Government hereby extends the deadline for submitting proposals to 17:00 (local Gambia time) on 6th September 2022. By this date, all proposals must be submitted in accordance with the requirements of the RFP document available for download on www.MoPE.gm.

The Gambia looks forward to furthering updates throughout the year and thanks the Africa Oil Week for its ongoing support of the Gambian A1 Block round
