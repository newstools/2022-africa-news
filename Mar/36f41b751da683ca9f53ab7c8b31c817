                            Clickatell (https://bit.ly/3IiVTbo), a CPaaS innovator and Chat Commerce leader announced it has launched the integration of its industry-leading Chat 2 Pay (https://bit.ly/3KMWKTl) payment solution with Salesforce Commerce Cloud (https://sforce.co/3CPEAxM), the fastest path to unified commerce.





Clickatell’s integration empowers Commerce Cloud customers to achieve enhanced payment options by allowing contact center agents to trigger payment requests via a payment link in chat messages. With Chat 2 Pay, customers pay for goods and services via Salesforce Order Management by simply clicking on a link delivered through SMS or WhatsApp without requiring them to expose their personal payment information to a human agent. Upon clicking the link, the customer is served a fully hosted checkout page where the customer can securely enter payment card details and submit the payment. The customer receives a confirmation of the order and a receipt via a chat message, while the contact center agent is kept abreast of the payment status to complete the sale.



Features and benefits of Chat 2 Pay include:
                                Businesses can meet their customers’ purchasing and servicing expectations with Clickatell’s Chat 2 Pay payment solution
