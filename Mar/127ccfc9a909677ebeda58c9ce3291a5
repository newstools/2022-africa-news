This activity of achievement sharing of FAO from 2019 to 2021 in Senegal, held on 4 March 2022, was an opportunity to show its expertise and especially its contribution to the implementation of the agricultural policy of the Government of Senegal in connection with its mission underlined  by  Dr  Gouantoueu  Robert  Guéi,  Sub-regional  Coordinator  for  West  Africa  and  FAO Representative in Senegal "FAO is accompanying Senegal in all sectors of the rural economy to improve agricultural, forestry and fisheries practices in order to sustainably manage natural resources, produce responsibly and ensure good nutrition for all. "



The country programming framework for Senegal was developed in a participatory and inclusive manner and is structured around three key priorities: (i) promotion of a sustainable, diversified, competitive, inclusive and growth-enhancing agro-sylvo-pastoral, fisheries and aquaculture sector; (ii) improvement  of  food  security  and  nutrition  and  strengthening  the  resilience  of  vulnerable populations; (iii) sustainable management of the environment and natural resources.



After three years of implementation, the CPF has to its credit numerous results generated through 40 projects for a total amount of 11,96322,1 US dollars. Among other results, with regard to the fight against desertification, the restoration of 6,000 ha of degraded land, the restoration of 1,000 ha of community reserve with the reintroduction of 6 oryx and the production of 12,000 m3 of fodder for animal feed.
