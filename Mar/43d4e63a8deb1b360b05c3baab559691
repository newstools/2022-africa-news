The ratification of the MLC, 2006 by Sierra Leone, a country with over 400 kilometres of Atlantic coastline, will contribute to improving the regulatory framework of its maritime sector in line with the country’s national development plan 2019-2023. The effective implementation of the Convention will promote decent working and living conditions for an important number of seafarers. According to the latest estimates, Sierra Leone had a fleet of 331 ships, representing 1,545,729 Gross Tonnage and 9856 seafarers.

The MLC, 2006 will enter into force for Sierra Leone on 29 March 2023, one year after its ratification.
