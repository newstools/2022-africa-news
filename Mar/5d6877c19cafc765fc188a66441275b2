Al Suwaidi urged all warring parties in Libya to respect their obligations under international laws and conventions to ensure the protection of civilians. She stressed the importance of ending cases of impunity and ensuring accountability for all those responsible for crimes and human rights violations, noting that this contributes to promoting national reconciliation and limits violations and prevents their recurrence.

She urged the international community and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue providing technical assistance and capacity-building, especially in the field of human rights, in line with the priorities set by the Libyan government, as well as assisting it in addressing the problem of illegal immigration and combating human trafficking.

Jawhara Al Suwaidi expressed Qatar's hope that all Libyan parties will give priority to the interests of Libya and its people over narrow political and personal interests, reiterating Qatar's support for the course of the political process.

She also urged all parties to move forward to hold free and fair national elections that would contribute to achieving the aspirations of the Libyan people and preserving the sovereignty, independence and unity of Libya.
