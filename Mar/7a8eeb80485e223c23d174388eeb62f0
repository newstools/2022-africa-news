                            On March 18, the U.S. Embassy successfully concluded a two-week Human Resource Management Workshop designed to develop the Malagasy Navy’s ability to optimize its personnel planning, recruitment, and professional development. This workshop, in line with the Malagasy National Defense Strategy, is part of the U.S. government’s ongoing efforts to help the Malagasy Navy develop a force capable of operating effectively throughout Madagascar’s large Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

Alongside participants from the Malagasy Navy, other representatives came from the Ministry of Defense, including the Army and Air Force, as well as from the Ministry of Public Works, the Ministry of Fisheries and Blue Economy, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research; and the Ministry of Transportation. This broad participation enabled open collaboration and communication about issues in human resource management across the Malagasy government. 

Ambassador Amy J. Hyatt presented certificates to all participants and encouraged them to use the knowledge acquired from the workshop to continue to review and strengthen policies and procedures within the Malagasy Navy and the Ministries to empower the military and civil service workforces.
