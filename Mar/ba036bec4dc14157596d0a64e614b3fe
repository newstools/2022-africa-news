                            U.S. classical pianist Pauline Yang arrived in Nigeria as an #ArtsEnvoy2022 sponsored by the Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs. During her 11 days in Nigeria, Pauline will perform, conduct workshops, and engage with media and musicians across Abuja, Lagos, and Ibadan. Pauline performed American, European and Mexican piano compositions before an enthralled Abuja audience that included musicians, members of the art community, Foreign Minister Onyeama, and other government officials. Through cross-cultural exchange, our Arts Envoys help promote inclusive dialogue and mutual understanding. Listen to one of Ms. Yang’s Abuja concerts here.
