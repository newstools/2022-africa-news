                            The COVID-19 pandemic's immense impact on businesses can no longer be ignored. It has become a tremendous stimulant for transformation projects in African enterprises across nearly all markets, with organisations investing resources, time and considerable effort in upgrading their digital services in hopes of taking advantage of the rapid digital revolution that is taking Africa by storm.



As reported by the World Economic Forum Africa, the digital economy could contribute close to $180 billion to the region’s growth by the mid-decade. Time, however, is of the essence.

Organisations that seek to compete in today’s super-dynamic marketplace are quickly realising the importance of a comprehensive Digital Transformation business model that incorporates diverse technologies across various spectrums.
