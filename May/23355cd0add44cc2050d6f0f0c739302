Ms Dlulane said she heard with sadness of the passing of this distinguished gospel singer, who attained so many accolades during her lifetime. “The family and the arts sector have sustained a great loss. We understand their pain; there will never be another Deborah,” said Ms Dlulane.

Ms Fraser was a veteran, who performed with Hugh Masekela and Brenda Fassie, among others, before she went on to release Abanye Bayombona in early 2000.

Ms Fraser reportedly passed away in a Johannesburg hospital on Sunday. “The industry has lost a giant. May her soul rest in eternal peace,” said Ms Dlulane.
