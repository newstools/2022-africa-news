ABUJA, Nigeria, February 11, 2022/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            Following the explosion and sinking of the Trinity FPSO, without journalistic research or confirmation, Hawilti published a press release on its website on 03 February 2022, falsely associating Atlas and its OML 109 operations in a damaging manner.



Following threat of legal action by ATLAS, Mr. Mickael Vogel, Director and Head of Research, in a letter dated 07 February 2022, acknowledged that “It seems that our coverage was based on misinterpreted information. There was a lack of due-diligence from our editorial desk”.
                                Hawilti is currently subject to litigation by investors whose funds were questionably secured by Mr. Vogel who refused to transfer the agreed equity to same investors
                            

It is gathered that Hawilti is currently subject to litigation by investors whose funds were questionably secured by Mr. Vogel who refused to transfer the agreed equity to same investors. ATLAS, upon learning of Hawilti’s shady history was wary of the purport of Hawilti’s misinformation, given the potential damage that could have been caused in respect of ATLAS’ ongoing investor relationships.    

Upon receipt of Hawilti’s apology and retraction, especially the acknowledgement of the lack of due diligence of its editorial desk, Prince Arthur Eze, Chairman of ATLAS, stated that he had been shocked by the particular interest of “these shady characters” in ATLAS’ business, but he had forgiven Hawilti and warned Mickael Vogel and Hawilti against continued engagement in fraudulent activity in Nigeria and Africa. He urged them to follow best business practice.

We can confirm that Hawilti’s website currently bears the retraction on its front page.
