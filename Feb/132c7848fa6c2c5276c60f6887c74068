                            On the afternoon of February 26, the Association of Ugandan Graduates in Cuba called on its members to strengthen the influence of the organization in Ugandan society.



Roland Mukana Shimey, President of the Association, called for the initiation of a new stage of work that has as its axis the greatest cohesion of all generations of graduates in Cuba around solidarity with the Caribbean nation and to contribute with a greater knowledge of the Cuban reality in Ugandan youth.

In an afternoon of reunions, music and Cuban dances, as well as renewed commitments, Tania Perez Xiques, Ambassador of Cuba in Uganda and Elizabeth Musazi, Ambassador-designate of Uganda in Cuba participated.

Likewise, it was an honor to have the presence of Professor Tarsis Kabweyere, a prominent Ugandan politician whose personal and family life is closely linked to Cuba.
