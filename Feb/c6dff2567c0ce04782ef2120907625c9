“We are discharging a public duty and although people are saying we have made this political, we are politicians who have a duty to our community faced with threats of torture, murder, extortion and all manner of vices,” Mpuuga said.

Only last week, the Opposition stormed out of the plenary over the continued torture and arrest of some Ugandans. They cited the arrest of legislators, Hon Muhammad Ssegirinya and Hon Allan Ssewanyana of Kawempe Division North and Makindye Division West, respectively.

In related development, the Opposition has started collecting signatures to censure the Minister for Security, Gen. (Rtd) Jim Muhwezi.
