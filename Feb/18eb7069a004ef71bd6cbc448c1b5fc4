LILONGWE, Malawi, February 7, 2022/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            The U.S. government has thus far provided $100,000 (81 million MWK) in international disaster assistance funding to meet immediate humanitarian needs resulting from the flooding in southern Malawi. The assistance comes in response to President Lazarus Chakwera’s declared state of disaster and request for donor assistance.


                                U.S. assistance in evacuation camps will promote safety, dignity, and equitable access, especially for the most vulnerable including elderly people, women, and children
                            

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Catholic Relief Services (CRS) are partnering with the Government of Malawi to provide flood-displaced populations with urgently needed shelter, water, and sanitation and hygiene (WASH) supplies. U.S. assistance will also help protect Malawians temporarily living in evacuation camps.

USAID, in partnership with CRS, will provide 1,000 flood-affected households with WASH kits so that they can safely gather and store potable water. To help mitigate health risks associated with the flooding, USAID is offering hygiene promotion to more than 2,000 people. The donation will also provide flood-affected households with relief items such as blankets and kitchen utensils.

U.S. assistance in evacuation camps will promote safety, dignity, and equitable access, especially for the most vulnerable including elderly people, women, and children. Once displaced persons can safely return to their communities, USAID will provide them with construction materials so that they can rebuild their homes.

The U.S. government is committed to supporting the Malawian people to respond to and recover from the disastrous results of Tropical Cyclone Ana.
