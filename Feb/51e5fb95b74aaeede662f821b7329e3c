TUNIS, Tunisia, February 8, 2022/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The  Ambassadors of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the European Union in Tunisia are deeply concerned about the announcement of the intention to unilaterally dissolve the Supreme Judicial Council whose mission is to ensure the sound functioning of the justice system and respect for its independence.  A transparent, independent and efficient judiciary and the separation of powers are essential for a functioning democracy that serves its people, on the basis of the rule of law and fundamental rights and freedoms.
