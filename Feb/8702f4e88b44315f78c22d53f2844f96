PRETORIA, South Africa, February 4, 2022/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The Government of South Africa condemns the attempted coup d’état and acts of violence in Guinea-Bissau that took place on 01 February 2022. South Africa supports the African Union and the Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS) in condemning these acts.


                                The attempt to change the government by violence must be stopped in Africa and democracy must guide all political processes
                            

We are pleased that the attempted coup has been thwarted and that the President and his cabinet are safe.

We send our thoughts to the families and the people of Guinea-Bissau who lost loved ones in the violence. The attempt to change the government by violence must be stopped in Africa and democracy must guide all political processes.

The South African government strongly rejects unlawful seizure of power by any group or individual as this undermines democracy and development and retards the realisation of Africa’s aspiration for a better Africa as set out in our Agenda 2063.
