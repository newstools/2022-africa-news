PRETORIA, South Africa, February 24, 2022/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The South African Government is concerned about the ongoing tensions in the Ukraine and Russia border, a situation if allowed to further deteriorate, could have regional and global ramifications.



South Africa urges all parties to devote increased efforts to diplomacy and to find a solution that will help de-escalate tensions and avert armed conflict.
                                The UNSC is the body given the mandate for maintenance of international peace and security and it must exercise its role fully
                            

Commenting on the situation, the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Dr Naledi Pandor said: “All parties have much to gain from a negotiated outcome and much to lose from an unnecessary and violent conflict.”

South Africa further calls on the UN Security Council to play a central role in the search for peace.

“The UNSC is the body given the mandate for maintenance of international peace and security and it must exercise its role fully. As South Africa, we believe all the issues of concern to any of the parties must be addressed in inclusive talks led by the UNSG.” Minister Pandor said.

The world does not need another war as that will result in death and destruction, hence our call for enhanced diplomacy.
