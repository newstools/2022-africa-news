ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, February 22, 2022/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The African Union Economic, Social and Cultural Council (AU-ECOSOCC) has launched an online survey for the general public on the harmonised mechanism for granting CSO observer/consultative status and the ECOSOCC National Chapter Framework.



Executive Council Decision EX/CL 890 (XXVII) of June 2015 calls upon ECOSOCC to collaborate with the African Union Commission and AU Member States to actively pursue a harmonised mechanism and clear criteria for the granting of AU consultative and observer status to Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Africa.
                                This participatory process will ensure the development of inclusive and robust frameworks for the accreditation of CSOs and the National ECOSOCC Chapters
                            

Likewise, Executive Council Decision EX/CL/Dec. 869 (XXVI) of January 2015, calls on ECOSOCC to facilitate the establishment of national ECOSOCC Chapters as a framework for accountability of elected members, as well as a conduit for disseminating information and mobilising support for AU programmes and activities, in close collaboration with Member States.

The African citizenry (including diaspora) is invited to contribute to the knowledge development process through a three-phase online public consultation that will be complemented with a series of virtual consultations. This participatory process will ensure the development of inclusive and robust frameworks for the accreditation of CSOs and the National ECOSOCC Chapters.

To participate in the online consultation process, interested parties can visit  https://www.auecosocc.org/au-cso-frameworks

ECOSOCC is mandated to actively engage civil society in the processes and work of the Union, particularly with regards to Africa’s integration and development.
