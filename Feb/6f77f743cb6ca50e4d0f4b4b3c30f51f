The aim of the meeting was to discuss necessary arrangements being made for the festival that respect the strict sanitary and restrictive measures currently in force so as to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in Mauritius.

In a statement following the meeting, Acting Commissioner of Police Dip recalled that the Prime Minister already chaired two meetings of the National Task Force, where representatives of socio-cultural associations made proposals for the Maha Shivratree 2022 festival.

He highlighted that discussions focussed on all sanitary and precautionary measures that need to be observed so that the festival can be held in the best conditions possible.

Mr Dip appealed to the public at large to collaborate with relevant authorities so as to avoid mass gatherings at Grand Bassin, to strictly abide by sanitary measures and to exercise discipline during the festival. He reminded that citizens must collaborate with the authorities in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and to avoid creating a Grand Bassin cluster.
