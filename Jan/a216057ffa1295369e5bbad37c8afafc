This donation, coordinated by COVAX, will help protect the population of Djibouti, including persons under the age of 18, from the COVID-19 virus and prevent the further spread of the virus’ new strains. The U.S. Government fully supports the Djiboutian authorities’ vaccination efforts and encourages everyone to get vaccinated.

U.S. Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Andrea Tomaszewicz and USAID Acting Country Representative Martha Dye toured the hospital storage facility today along with representatives from UNICEF and Dr. Omar Mahamoud Ismael, the Coordinator of the Ministry of Health’s Vaccine Program. DCM Tomaszewicz emphasized the United States’ longstanding commitment to ensuring access to health services for the people of Djibouti, and how this assistance is even more important now as we all face the challenges of the new variants of COVID-19 together.

The donation of the Pfizer vaccine, along with the Johnson and Johnson vaccines donated by the U.S. in July of last year, provides another example of how the partnership between the U.S. and Djibouti is working to benefit all Djiboutians.
