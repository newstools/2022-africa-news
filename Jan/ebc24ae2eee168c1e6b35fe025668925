Through this project, AAR Japan will encourage 11 self-help groups comprised of 463 households by 1) providing agricultural equipment and skills on household management, 2) providing cash-rich seedlings and know-how on farming, and 3) promoting joint transportation and expansion of sales channels. Further, in collaboration with Community Road Empowerment (CORE), a Japanese NPO, AAR Japan will work with the target self-groups to pave rough roads to the nearby market to facilitate a smooth joint transportation system in the community.

This project by AAR Japan is expected to revitalise the targeted farmers’ agricultural activities and increase their cash income, which will lead to the promotion of their self-sustainable livelihood basis.
