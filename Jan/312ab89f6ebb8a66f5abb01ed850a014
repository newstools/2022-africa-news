PRETORIA, South Africa, January 13, 2022/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD) wishes to inform subsistence farmers who are beneficiaries of the Presidential Employment Stimulus (PES) vouchers of the decision to suspend all PES implementation with immediate effect until further notice. The department is reviewing, reengineering and redesigning PES implementation, to address all challenges experienced.


                                Beneficiaries are further urged to check their cell phones’ messages as sent by the department from time to time
                            

It is unfortunate that the department has received endless complaints from the PES beneficiaries and the South African community at large, regarding various challenges on the PES implementation. These implementation challenges cannot be left unattended, hence the decision by the department to temporarily halt the current implementation.

Beneficiaries are further urged to check their cell phones’ messages as sent by the department from time to time.

The department had issued production input vouchers in support of subsistence producers, as part of the Presidential Employment Stimulus (PES) in South Africa.
