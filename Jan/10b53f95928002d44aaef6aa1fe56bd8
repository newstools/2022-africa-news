                            Five African localities have published Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs) of their frameworks and progress towards regional and global sustainable development goals. These VLRs – in Accra, Harare, Ngora District, Victoria Falls and Yaoundé – were supported by ECA and are among a first wave of local-level reviews undertaken across Africa, with many more on the way.

Sub-national governments and stakeholders play a pivotal role in the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and Agenda 2063 of the African Union. Grassroots initiatives undertaken at the local level have been integral to responding to COVID, protecting the environment, and ensuring inclusive development across Africa. As countries continue to evaluate their progress towards the two agendas through Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs), interest in pursuing this review process at the local level has been growing exponentially.

These African VLRs have informed the production of African Regional Guidelines for VLRs. These Guidelines – produced in partnership with UN-Habitat and United Cities and Local Governments of Africa (UCLG-A) – will be published shortly, and used to inform future reviews.

As cities, districts and governorates increasingly engage in these processes, ECA stands ready to work closely with them and a coalition of other partners to push the SDG localization agenda forward.
