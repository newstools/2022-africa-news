MONROVIA, Liberia, January 31, 2022/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                             Liberian friends joined the voices of many countries of the world in denouncing the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America on the Greater Antilles and demanding the end of this genocidal policy against the Cuban people.



On this day, there were dissimilar expressions of support for Cuba and condemnation of the blockade, considered the longest, cruelest and most inhumane in the history of mankind.

The day for the end of this genocidal policy of the United States against Cuba and in favor of the bridges of love was called for this January 30 by organizations and movements in solidarity with Cuba in various parts of the world.
