Sudanese women’s strong participation in these sessions marks UNITAMS commitment to engaging women’s rights leaders and women’s groups in these processes as well as ensuring their voices, views and vision are documented and heard. UNITAMS continues to call for the meaningful representation of women across political, civil and armed groups who are part of the consultations.

Sudanese stakeholders continue to offer valuable and concrete suggestions on overcoming the current political impasse. UNITAMS strives to collect and document the proposals Sudanese stakeholders present during these consultations.. “Our role at this stage is to hear Sudanese stakeholders and ensure that we actively listen to their views and document their visions and suggestions”, said Stephanie Khoury, Director of Political Affairs Office at UNITAMS.

During the next few days, additional consultations will be held with representatives of various Sudanese stakeholders.
